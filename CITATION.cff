abstract: >-
  SeisSol is an open-source software package for
  simulating 3D seismic, acoustic, and gravity waves
  as well as earthquake rupture dynamics. It implements
  high-order accurate seismic wave propagation in elastic,
  anisotropic, viscoelastic, and poroelastic media,
  using an arbitrary high-order
  derivative discontinuous Galerkin (ADER-DG)
  discretization on unstructured adaptive tetrahedral
  meshes. SeisSol's dynamic rupture implementation
  supports linear slip weakening, classic rate-and-state
  friction and fast-velocity weakening friction and can
  be combined with Drucker-Prager off-fault plasticity,
  and thermal pressurization.
  SeisSol is optimized for large-scale supercomputing
  platforms, supporting CPU parallelization via hybrid
  MPI+OpenMP and MPI+CUDA/HIP/SYCL for GPU architectures.
