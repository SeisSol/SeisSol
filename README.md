This is a development version of SeisSol (www.seissol.org).

**SeisSol is still under heavy development and comes without any guaranteed funcitonality. At the moment we can only provide very limited support for general users. Please contact [Alice Gabriel](http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/Members/gabriel) if you are interested in a close collaboration.**

For further information on running SeisSol and a first example see our
[Documentation] (https://seissol.readthedocs.io)
