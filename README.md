SeisSol is a scientific software for the numerical simulation of seismic wave phenomena and earthquake dynamics. It is based on the discontinuous Galerkin method combined with ADER time discretization. Visit our [official website](http://www.seissol.org/) and also read our [documentation](https://seissol.readthedocs.io) in order to learn more about SeisSol.

### Note
SeisSol is still under heavy development and comes without any guaranteed funcitonality. At the moment we can only provide very limited support for general users.
