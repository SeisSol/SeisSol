SeisSol is a scientific software for the numerical simulation of seismic wave
phenomena and earthquake dynamics. It is based on the discontinuous Galerkin
method combined with ADER time discretization. Visit our [official website](http://www.seissol.org/)
and also read our [documentation](https://seissol.readthedocs.io) in order to
learn more about SeisSol. Our [discussion forum](https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol/discussions)

## Note

SeisSol is still under heavy development and comes without any guaranteed
