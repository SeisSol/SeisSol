#---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Purpose: compute distance to faces and nodes in the reference
#           tetrahedron
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# usage:
#   python distances.py
#
# input:
#   assumes to find a file 'xi_eta_zeta.txt' in the working directory
#   containing the reference coordinates of the stations
#
# output:
#   produces to files 'dist_to_nodes.txt' and 'dist_to_faces.txt' containg the
#   distance to the closest node an face of each station. Thresholds for
#   warnings on the command line can be defined below.

# for nodes:
