%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% BRIEF INTRODUCTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% In viscoelastic materials there exists phase velocity dispersion,
%% meaning that the velocities of the waves vary with the frequency. In the
%% viscoelastic model used in SeisSol (Generalized Maxwell Body, GMB), the
%% velocities are maximum for infinity frequency and get lower at lower
%% frequencies, but other models behave differently. The shape of this
%% curves depends on the attenuation chosen (quality factor QP and QS) as
%% well as the bandwidth and central frequency of the attenuating
%% mechanisms.
%%   For most practical applications, we know QP and QS as well as the
%% seismic wave velocities at some particular frequency, often the source's
%% peak frequency. The input of SeisSol, however, is QP and QS and the
%% seismic wave velocities at infinite frequency. In order to transform
%% from one value set to the other we just need to run this script.
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% USAGE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The script's input is the following:
%%   QPval,QSval: quality factor of the P and S waves
%%   n:           number of attenuating mechanisms
%%   freq:        frequency at which the phase velocities are defined
%%   f_ratio:     frequency bandwidth of attenuating mechanisms
%%   rho:         the material's density, which is frequency independent
%%   vp_t, vs_t:  target wave velocities at frequency "freq"
%%   vp_0, vs_0:  wave velocities at infinite frequency (unrelaxed
%%                velocities)
%%   In a first run, vp_0 and vs_0 are unknown so we can set them at the same
%% value as vp_t and vs_t. The program will then output in the screen the
%% recommended values for vp_0 and vs_0 given the proposed setup. For
%% double-checking one can then re-run the script now assigning the
%% previously obtained vp_0 and vs_0 values so that we are certain that the
%% values computed are correct.
