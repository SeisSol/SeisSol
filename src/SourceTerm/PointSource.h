/** The local moment tensor shall be transformed into the global coordinate system.
 *
 * The second order tensor (matrix) can be understood as a transform
 * on a vector, e.g. p_L = T_L * q_L. (Let L = Local moment tensor, M = Moment tensor.)
 * We are looking for the transformed tensor p_M = T_M * q_M, i.e.
 * the local moment tensor rotated by strike, dip, and rake.
 * Assume x_L = R * x_M, where R is an orthogonal matrix. Then
 * p_M = R^T * p_L = R^T * T_L * R * q_M and hence
 *   T_M = R^T * T_L * R.
 * Thus, the rotation matrix R is the transformation from the global (x,y,z)
 * coordinate system to local (fault plane) coordinate system and is obtained
 * by the successive rotations  strike (s) -> dip (d) -> rake (l).
