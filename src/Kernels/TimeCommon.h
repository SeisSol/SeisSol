       * Either copies pointers to the DOFs in the time buffer or integrates the DOFs via time derivatives.
       *   Evaluation depends on bit 0-3  of the LTS setup.
       *   0 -> copy buffer; 1 -> integrate via time derivatives
       *     Example:

       *     [     4 unused     | copy or int bits  ]
       *     [ -    -    -    - |  0    1    1    0 ]
       *     [ 7    6    5    4 |  3    2    1    0 ]
       *
       *   0 - 0: time integrated DOFs of cell 0 are copied from the buffer.
       *   1 - 1: DOFs of cell 1 are integrated in time via time derivatives.
       *   2 - 1: DOFs of cell 2 are integrated in time via time derivaitves.
       *   3 - 0: time itnegrated DOFs of cell 3 are copied from the buffer.
       *
       * @param i_ltsSetup bitmask for the LTS setup.
       * @param i_faceTypes face types of the neighboring cells.
       * @param i_currentTime current time of the cell [0] and it's four neighbors [1], [2], [3] and [4].
       * @param i_timeStepWidth time step width of the cell.
       * @param i_timeDofs pointers to time integrated buffers or time derivatives of the four neighboring cells.
       * @param i_integrationBuffer memory where the time integration goes if derived from derivatives. Ensure thread safety!
       * @param o_timeIntegrated pointers to the time integrated DOFs of the four neighboring cells (either local integration buffer or integration buffer of input).
