  
# Description

This folder contains scripts to compute Ground motions parameters (e.g. PGA, PGV, PGD, SA(T)) from a SeisSol surface output file.

# Prerequisites

The main script (ComputeGroundMotionParametersFromSurfaceOutput_Hybrid.py) requires gmpe-smtk. The latest gmpe-smtk depends on openquake, but some older versions do not require this dependency. Therefore, one can choose to either install the deprecated gmpe-smtk without openquake, or the latest gmpe-smtk with openquake.

## Installing a deprecated gmpe-smtk
In this case, no installation is needed, the repository only needs to be cloned:

```
git clone https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gmpe-smtk
cd gmpe-smtk
git checkout 4f008173e89f6e4ba4450fb43e95ffdf51a7c2ba^
#now add gmpe-smtk to your python path
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:'$(pwd)
##you could also consider adding it to your ~.bashrc
#echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:'$(pwd) >> ~/.bashrc

```
## Installing the latest gmpe-smtk and openquake

Here is a proposed workflow for installing openquake:
```
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gem/oq-engine/master/requirements-py38-linux64.txt openquake.engine
pip install openquake.engine
```
On SupermucNG, see https://seissol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supermuc.html#accessing-pypi for using pip.

The installation on other operating system that Linux is documented here:
https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/tree/master/doc/installing

You can test the installation by running an example:

```
oq engine --help
#alternative
git clone https://github.com/gem/oq-engine.git --depth 1
oq run oq-engine/demos/hazard/AreaSourceClassicalPSHA/job.ini
```
Then the latest gmpe-smtk can be cloned and added to the pythonpath as previously described.

## Installing other python modules

Simply use:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If not root, use ``--user``.

# Running the script
 
All the available option for running the script can be displayed using:

```
python3 ComputeGroundMotionParametersFromSurfaceOutput_Hybrid.py -h
```

A typical example for running the script on a desktop can be:
```
python3 ComputeGroundMotionParametersFromSurfaceOutput_Hybrid.py --MP 4 prefix-surface.xdmf --noMPI
```
(assuming a 4 cores processor).

The script can also be used on a high performance cluster, see SupermucNGCommandFileComputeGroundMotions.sh for an example of a job file on supermucNG.
