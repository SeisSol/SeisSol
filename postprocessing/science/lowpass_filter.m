% @section DESCRIPTION
% LOWPASS_FILTER applies a low-pass filter to a time signal 
% given by the "colums" vector s.
% dt is the sampling rate of the signal s.
% cf_left  is the left corner frequency up to which the filter function is 1.  
% cf_right is the right corner frequency beyond which the fileter is zero.
% Between cf_left and cf_right the filter function decays with as the
% cosine-function.

s_length = length(s);

% check for odd number of samples and make it even 
% by skipping the last sample
if(mod(s_length,2)==1)
    s_length = s_length-1;
    s = s(1:end-1);
end

% Fourier transform the signal
F = fft(s);
% Frequency sampling rate
df = 1/(s_length*dt);

freq = df * (0:s_length-1)';

filter_func = 0.5*( 1 + cos(pi*(freq-cf_left)/(cf_right-cf_left)) );
filter_func(freq<cf_left)  = 1;
filter_func(freq>cf_right) = 0;
%plot(freq,filter_func),pause

% multiply spectrum F with filter function 
s_filt = F.*filter_func;

% make filtered signal symmetric
s_filt(s_length/2+2:end) = conj( s_filt(s_length/2:-1:2) );

% Apply inverse Fourier transform
s_filt = real(ifft(s_filt));
