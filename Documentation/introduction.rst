History
============

The software package SeisSol (http://www.seissol.org/) allows for
realistic simulations of the three-dimensional seismic wavefield
propagating in complex Earth structures generated by a finite dynamic
earthquake source governed by a constitutive law that describes the
relationship between fault stress and slip across a geometrically complex
fault. SeisSol is a high-order accurate *Discontinuous Galerkin Finite
Element* solver, based on the ADER-DG method presented
in Kaser and Dumbser (2006), enabling precise modeling of on-fault
frictional failure coupled to seismic waves traveling over large
distances in terms of propagated wavelengths with minimal dispersion
errors, whereas it is intrinsically dissipative and removes frequencies
unresolved by the mesh without affecting longer and physically
meaningful wavelengths. de la Puente et al. (2009) and Pelties et al. (2012) introduced Riemann solution to handle discontinuous fault slip conditions and achieve earthquake dynamics with seismic wave propagation.

The software has recently proven to be highly scalable on current and
future HPC infrastructure. It reached multi-petaflop/s performance on
some of the largest supercomputers worldwide in a pioneering simulation of the 1992 M7.2 Landers earthquake (Heinecke et al.,
2014; Breuer et al., 2016). High detail rupture evolution and synthetic ground shaking in the
engineering frequency band (0-10 Hz) were modeled on a non-planar
earthquake fault structure. In early 2017, SeisSol performed the longest
and largest dynamic rupture scenario to date, enabled by local time
stepping (Uphoff et al.,2017), resolving the 2004
Sumatra-Andaman earthquake including complex splay fault geometries. The
paper won the prestigious “Best Paper Award” of the International
Supercomputing Conference (SC17). SeisSol results imply that
acknowledging geometrical complexity, realistic fault properties, and
velocity models affect not only earthquake source dynamics but the
synthetic ground shaking crucially. The software package is available to
the community as an open-source distribution
(https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol).
