Known Issues
============

Download
--------

-  **The submodule directories are empty.** To clone the code including
   all submodules, use

   ::

      git clone --recursive https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol.git

   If you already cloned the repository without ``--recursive``, you can
   use the following command to get the submodules.

   ::

      git submodule update --init --recursive

Installation
------------

-  **The build process fails because of missing files.** SeisSol
   requires some external libraries which are integrated via git submodules. For some of the libraries it is important to have the
   correct version (e.g. the XMDF Writer) because of changes in the
   interface of the library. If you clone the submodules with git, you
   should always get the correct version. However, downloading the
   SeisSol and its submodules directly from the Github homepage might result in an incorrect combination of versions.

-  **The parallel SCons build fails when Scalasca is enabled.** Scorep
   can not compile two files in parallel if they have the same name even if they are in different subdirectories. As a workaround when
   building SeisSol with Scalasca, omit the ``-j`` option.

-  | **The SCons configuration step fails, although all dependencies are
     installed and all variables are correct.**
   | SCons maintains a cache in the root directory. When you build
     different versions of SeisSol or your environment changes (e.g.
     compiler update), the cache might not be evicted correctly. You can use the option ``--config=force`` in when running SCons or delete the hidden cache folder ``.sconf_temp`` in SeisSol root directory.

Asynchronous output
-------------------

Some MPI versions have issues with threads and I/O. The MPI-IO
implementation is either not threadsafe or too strict when it comes to
locking. This can lead to crashes or deadlocks when using the
asynchronous output. A simple workaround is to use the POSIX back-end of
the XDMF writer, this is compiling SeisSol without HDF5. For
checkpointing, one should also switch to POSIX or SIONlib.

.. _easi-and-intel/16.0:

easi and Intel/16.0
-------------------

Using Intel/16.0 in a local cluster, compile error occurs in
PUMLreader.cpp Using Intel/17.0 will solve this.

Using Intel/16.0 on supermuc, we observed some bugs in the fault stress
initialization (you can see the imprint of some partitions in the
initial stress). The bugs are not showing off with latest Intel/17.0
module.

.. _"holes"-in-the-fault-output:

"Holes" in the fault output
---------------------------

"Holes" in the fault output may appear if the reference point or
reference vector, defined by (Xref, Yref, and Zref) is wrongly located
(point exactly on the fault, or null vector).
