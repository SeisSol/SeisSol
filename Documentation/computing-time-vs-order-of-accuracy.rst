Computing time vs order of accuracy
===================================

Using a higher order implies using smaller time steps and using more
basis functions.
The expected increase in computed time can then be estimated as follow:

| Decrease of the time steps width by a factor: :math:`(2N+1)/(2n+1)`
| Increase of the number of basis functions by a factor:
  :math:`(N+1)(N+2)(N+3)/((n+1)(n+2)(n+3))`
| with:
| n: initial order of accuracy -1
| N: new order of accuracy -1

Here is an example of the theoretical increase of the compute time
relative to order 3

The last line shows the observed time increase on SuperMUC Phase 2 on a small
run with dynamic rupture and LTS-DR. Low order calculation (up to order
5 included) are memory bounds, and are then less efficient. As a
consequence, the higher-order simulations cost less than expected in
comparison with order 3.
