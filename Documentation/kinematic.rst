Kinematic source example - 1994 Northridge earthquake
=====================================================

We use this earthquake to demonstrate how to set up dynamic rupture model
with a kinematic rupture source in SeisSol.

The 1994 Northridge earthquake occurred on January 17, at 4:30:55 a.m.
PST and had its epicenter in Reseda, a neighborhood in the north-central
San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California, USA. It had a
duration of approximately 10–20 seconds. The blind thrust earthquake had
a magnitude of 6.7 (Mw). This is a typical reverse-slip earthquake. The
fault orients to N122\ :math:`^\circ`\ E and dips at 40\ :math:`^\circ`.
The simulation can be used to build a similar model with moderate
modifications.

Geometry
~~~~~~~~

The fault geometry is made in Gmsh. Fault: plane fault 20 km\*25 km
dipping at 40-degree.

Region: 100 km\*100 km \*60 km.

   Geometry of 1994 Northridge earthquake. A planar fault orients at 122
   degrees and dip at 40 degrees. The dimension of the fault is 20 km along strike and 25 km along down-dip.

Kinematic rupture Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The kinematic source of the earthquake can be found at . The *standard
rupture format* can be used directly in SeisSol, with the following
lines in parameter.par file.

::
  
  &SourceType
  Type = 42
  FileName=’northridge.nrf’
  /

Download standard rupture format file (northridge.srf) can be found in https://strike.scec.org/scecpedia/Standard_Rupture_Format.
Please note that the SCEC units are different with SeisSol units in some
aspect.

The fault is divided into 20 grids along the strike and 25 grids
  along the dip. The source time function (STF) of each rectangular
  elements is given in the file , whose format looks like the following:

Project geographic coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The geographic coordinates of the source model are projected to Cartesian
coordinates with the pre-processing tool `rconv 
<https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol/tree/master/preprocessing/science/rconv>`_.

::

  rconv -i northridge.srf -o northridge.nrf -m "+proj=merc +lon\_0=-118 +y\_0=-4050981.42 +x\_0=57329.54 +units=m +axis=enu" -x visualization.xdmf


To find the center of fault, use *cs2cs* in *proj.4* to convert the
coordinates:

::

  echo -118.5150 34.3440 0.0 | cs2cs +proj=lonlat +axis=enu +units=m +to +proj=merc +lon\_0=-118 +axis=enu +units=m
  

This cooperation will project the coordinates and shift the center of
fault to the origin (0,0) in Cartesian coordinates.

Results
~~~~~~~

Source rupture starts at 7.0 s and propagates in the domain. A snapshot
of velocity is shown in Figure [fig:northridge1]. The surface velocity
output is refined by subdividing each triangle into 4 subtriangles while
the domain output is not.
