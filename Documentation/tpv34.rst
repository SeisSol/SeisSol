SCEC TPV34
==========

The TPV34 benchmark features a right-lateral, planar, vertical, strike-slip fault 
set in a half-space. The velocity structure is the actual 3D velocity structure 
surrounding the Imperial Fault, as given by the SCEC Community Velocity Model
`CVM-H <https://strike.scec.org/scecpedia/CVM-H>`_.

   The Imperial Fault. The red line marks the Imperial Fault. It straddles the California-Mexico border, south of the Salton Sea. The Imperial Fault is approximately 45 km long and 15 km deep, with a nearly vertical dip angle ranging from 81 to 90 degrees according to the SCEC Community Fault Model CFM-4.

Geometry
~~~~~~~~

The model volume is a half-space. The fault is a vertical,
planar, strike-slip fault. The fault reaches the Earth’s surface. Rupture is
allowed within a rectangular area measuring 30000 m along-strike and
15000 m down-dip.

There is a circular nucleation zone on the fault surface. The hypocenter is 
located 15 km from the left edge of the fault, at a depth of 7.5 km.

The geometry is generated with `Gmsh <https://gmsh.info/>`_. All the files 
that are needed for the simulation are provided at

Material
~~~~~~~~

To obtain the velocity structure for TPV34, we need to install and run 
the SCEC Community Velocity Model software distribution `CVM-H <https://strike.scec.org/scecpedia/CVM-H>`_. 
For TPV34, we are using CVM-H version 15.1.0 and we use 
`ASAGI <https://github.com/TUM-I5/ASAGI>`_ to map the material properties variations onto the mesh. 
Detailed explanations are provided at 
https://github.com/SeisSol/Examples/blob/master/tpv34/generate_ASAGI_file.sh. 
We generate 2 netcdf files of different spatial resolution to map more finely the 3D material properties close to the fault. 
The domain of validity of each netcdf files read by ASAGI is defined by the yaml tpv34-material.yaml file:

.. code-block:: YAML

    components:
      # apply a finer CVM-H data inside the refinement zone
      - !AxisAlignedCuboidalDomainFilter

          x: [-25000.0, 25000.0]
          y: [-25000.0, 25000.0]
          z: [-25000.0, 0.0]
        components: !ASAGI
          file: tpv34_rhomulambda-inner.nc
          parameters: [rho, mu, lambda]
          var: data
      # apply a coarser CVM-H data outside the refinement zone
      - !ASAGI

          parameters: [rho, mu, lambda]

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

TPV34 uses a linear slip weakening law on the fault. The parameters are
listed in Table below.

+-------------+--------------------------------+------------+--------+
| Parameter   | inside the nucleation zone     | Value      | Unit   |
+=============+================================+============+========+
| mu\_s       | static friction coefficient    | 0.58       |        |
+-------------+--------------------------------+------------+--------+
| mu\_d       | dynamic friction coefficient   | 0.45       |        |
+-------------+--------------------------------+------------+--------+
| d\_c        | critical distance              | 0.18       | m      |
+-------------+--------------------------------+------------+--------+

The cohesion is 1.02 MPa at the earth’s surface. It is 0 MPa at depths 
greater than 2400 m, and is linearly tapered in the uppermost 2400 m. 
The spatial dependence of the cohesion is straightforwardly mapped 
using `Easi <https://github.com/SeisSol/easi>`_.

.. code-block:: YAML

  [mu_d, mu_s, d_c]: !ConstantMap
    map:
      mu_d: 0.45
      mu_s: 0.58
      d_c: 0.18
  [cohesion]: !FunctionMap
    map:
      cohesion: |
        return -425.0*max(z+2400.0,0.0);

Initial stress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The initial shear stress on the fault is pure right-lateral. 

  The initial shear stress is :math:`\tau_0` = (30 MPa)(:math:`\mu_x`) 

  The initial normal stress on the fault is :math:`\sigma_0` = (60 MPa)(:math:`\mu_x`).

In above formulas, we define :math:`\mu_x = \mu / \mu_0`, where 
:math:`\mu` is shear modulus and
:math:`\mu_0` = 32.03812032 GPa.

Results
~~~~~~~
All examples here can be visualized in Paraview. The *output* folder contains a series of files for
fault dynamic rupture (hdf5 and .xdmf), wavefield (hdf5 and .xdmf), on-fault receiver (.dat) and
off-fault receivers (.dat). The fault dynamic rupture and wavefield files can be loaded in Paraview. 
For example, open Paraview and then go through File > import > 'prefix'-fault.xdmf.
