SCEC TPV34
==========

The TPV34 benchmark uses a right-lateral, planar, vertical, strike-slip fault set in a half-space. The velocity
structure is the actual 3D velocity structure surrounding the Imperial Fault, as given by the SCEC
Community Velocity Model CVM-H.

   The Imperial Fault. The red line marks the Imperial Fault. It straddles the California-Mexico border, south of the Salton Sea. The Imperial Fault is approximately 45 km long and 15 km deep, with a nearly vertical dip angle ranging from 81 to 90 degrees according to the SCEC Community Fault Model CFM-4.

   Diagram of TPV 34. The fault is a vertical plane measuring 30 km along-strike and 15 km deep. The fault is a strike-slip, right-lateral fault. The fault reaches the earthâ€™s surface. There is a circular nucleation zone on the fault surface. The hypocenter is located 15 km from the left edge of the fault, at a depth of 7.5 km.
