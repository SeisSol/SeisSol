SeisSol is a software package for simulating wave propagation and dynamic
rupture based on the arbitrary high-order accurate derivative discontinuous
Galerkin method (ADER-DG).

Characteristics of the SeisSol simulation software are:

- use of arbitrarily high approximation order in time and space
- use of tetrahedral meshes to approximate complex 3D model geometries (faults & topography) and rapid model generation
- use of (an)isotropic elastic, viscoelastic and viscoplastic material to approximate realistic geological subsurface properties
- parallel geo-information input (ASAGI)
- to produce reliable and sufficiently accurate synthetic seismograms or other seismological data sets
