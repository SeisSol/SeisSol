A first example
===============

This tutorial will guide you through the steps of your first SeisSol
simulation. We will use the `SCEC TPV33
benchmark <http://scecdata.usc.edu/cvws/tpv33docs.html>`__ as an example
in this tutorial. We assume that you have successfully :ref:`compiled SeisSol
<build_seissol>`.

This tutorial is targeted to people who have compiled SeisSol and want
to test their installation for the first time. If you are completely new
to SeisSol and want to explore its features, we recommend our `training
material <https://github.com/SeisSol/Training>`__, which bundles a pre-compiled
version of SeisSol and some scenarios.


Setup
-----

*  Clone our examples repository: https://github.com/SeisSol/Examples/.

*  Navigate to the folder ``Examples/tpv33``. We will refer to this directory as
   `working directory` in the following.

*  Download the mesh files from `<https://zenodo.org/record/8042664>`__ and
   store them in the working directory.

*  You can visualize the mesh file with `paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`__,
   using e.g. ``paraview tpv33_half_sym.xdmf``. The mesh
   is described by two files: ``tpv33_half_sym`` and ``tpv33_half_sym.xdmf``.
   The first one is a binary file, which contains all the data (e.g.
   coordinates, connectivity) and the ``xdmf`` file contains information
   on how to read that data for visualization software such as Paraview.
   You can read more about this mesh format here: :ref:`PUML_mesh_format`.

*  Create the output directory: ``mkdir output``.

*  **Optional** To create the mesh on your own, execute ``./generating_the_mesh.sh``.
   To do so, you need to install `gmsh <https://gmsh.info>`__, `PUMGen
   <https://github.com/SeisSol/PUMGen>`__ and `mirrorMesh
   <https://github.com/SeisSol/Meshing/tree/master/mirrorMesh>`__.

*  **Optional:** For performance reasons, we suggest that you store large
   files (mesh, output) in a scratch file system (if one is available at your cluster)
   and create symbolic links in your working directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

     ln -s <path/to/tpv33_half_sym> tpv33_half_sym
     ln -s <path/to/output/directory> output

   You may not see a huge difference in this small test case but for larger
   meshes, this is the recommended strategy.

Execution
---------

*  Link the SeisSol binary to your working directory (``Examples/tpv33``).

*  Now run: ``export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<threads>``, where ``<threads>`` is the
   number of hardware threads. Furthermore, we highly recommend pinning the OpenMP threads to cores, by setting ``export OMP_PLACES="cores(<cores>)"``.
   If you are on a cluster or want to run with multiple MPI ranks, then you should set the number of OMP threads to the number of available threads
   minus 1 (the last thread is used for communication). In this case, you will also need to set ``export OMP_PLACES="cores(<cores-1>)"``,
   in order for SeisSol to detect one CPU core as "free".

*  Now run: ``mpiexec -np <n> ./SeisSol_<configuration> parameters.par``, where:

   *  ``<n>`` is the number of MPI ranks / the number of compute nodes used.

   *  ``<configuration>`` depends on your compilation setting (e.g. ``SeisSol_Release_dhsw_4_elastic`` for a Haswell architecture and order 4 accuracy in space and time).

   * When running on your local desktop computer, you may also run with only one MPI rank, i.e. leave away the ``mpiexec``, i.e. only type ``./SeisSol_<configuration> parameters.par``. Then, you can use all available threads.

**Hint:** Depending on the system you are using, the MPI launcher might
be different from ``mpiexec`` (e.g. ``mpiexec.hydra``, ``mpirun``, ``srun``).
For more infos about how to get optimal performance, have a look at the :ref:`optimal_environment_variables_on_supermuc_ng`.

Result visualization and verification
-------------------------------------

SeisSol produces various output files:

* :ref:`3D wave field output <wave_field_output>` (:code:`.xdmf`)
* :ref:`2D free surface output <free_surface_output>` (:code:`-surface.xdmf`)
* :ref:`2D fault output <paraview_output>` (:code:`-fault.xdmf`)
* :ref:`off_fault_receivers` (:code:`-receiver-<id>.dat`)
* :ref:`Fault receivers <fault_receivers>` (:code:`-faultreceiver-<id>.dat`)
* :ref:`energy_output` (:code:`-energy.csv`)

The :code:`xdmf` files can be visualized with `Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`__.
For the :code:`dat` files, you can use `viewrec <https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol/blob/master/postprocessing/visualization/receiver/bin/viewrec>`__.

For a smaller mesh and convergence order 6, we provide a reference solution in the ``precomputed-seissol`` repository which you may use to verify your installation.
Furthermore, the SCEC benchmark from the SCEC Code Verification Project `website <http://scecdata.usc.edu/cvws/cgi-bin/cvws.cgi>`__ has output files from other software to compare with.
