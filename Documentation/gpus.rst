SeisSol with GPUs
=======================================


General
~~~~~~~


The current GPU version of SeisSol targets latest NVidia Graphics cards. Therefore, you
need to have at least **CUDA 10** installed in your environment. Moreover, make sure
that your installed MPI implementation is **CUDA-Aware**. Here is a list of 
known CUDA-Aware MPI vendors:

- OpenMPI
- MVAPICH2
- CRAY MPI
- IBM Platform MPI
- SGI MPI

Please, referer to a corresponding documentation if you need to installed
CUDA-Aware MPI manually. We also ecourage you to bind your MPI with `UCX communication layer
<https://github.com/openucx/ucx>`_ if you need to manually configure CUDA-Aware MPI for a cluster or your local server 
with an open-source MPI implementation e.g., OpenMPI.

GPU version of SeisSol follows *single rank/single GPU* strategy. Therefore, 
if you want to run SeisSol on **M** nodes where each node is equipped with **N** GPUs then
make sure that you launch SeisSol with **M x N** MPI processes. 

To achieve the most efficient CPU-to-GPU communication and vice versa you have 
to pin your MPI processes to CPU cores which are the closest to the target 
GPUs. This problem is also known as GPU affinity. Latest versions of workload 
managers (e.g., SLURM) are aware about this problem and try to provide an 
automatic, GPU-aware process pinning. Consider the following SLURM options:

- `--ntasks-per-gpu`
- `--gpu-bind`

You can also enforce good GPU affinity with rankfiles if your GPU cluster or local server
does not use a workload manager but is equipped with multiple GPUs per node.

Supported SeisSol Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- elastic wave propagation model with kinematic point sources
- off-fault plasticity model


Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~

To start off, make sure that you already have **GemmForge** installed on your system. 
If you don't have then follow this :ref:`link <gemmforge_installation>`.

After that, get the latest version of SeisSol

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol.git seissol-gpu

Compile SeisSol with (e.g.)

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p seissol-gpu/build && cd seissol-gpu/build 
    cmake -DDEVICE_ARCH=nvidia -DDEVICE_SUB_ARCH=sm_70 -DHOST_ARCH=skx \
    -DCOMMTHREAD=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPRECISION=double ..
    make -j

Execution
~~~~~~~~~

A launching process of GPU version of SeisSol is exactly the same as in case
of the CPU version. 

.. code-block:: bash

    mpirun -n <M x N> ./SeisSol_*nvidia_* ./parameters.par

It is important to know that the GPU version of SeisSol allocates 1GB of
GPU memory at the beginning of SeisSol execution. It is necessary for fast allocation/deallocation
of GPU memory needed for holding temporary data. The default value can be changed by setting
a necessary one to **DEVICE_STACK_MEM_SIZE** environment variable. For example,
the following will force SeisSol to allocate 1.5GB of stack GPU memory for temporary data:


.. code-block:: bash
    
    export DEVICE_STACK_MEM_SIZE=1.5
    mpirun -n <M x N> ./SeisSol_*nvidia_* ./parameters.par
