Physical Models
===============

Overview
--------

SeisSol includes various physical models to simulate realistic earthquake scenarios.

Elastic
^^^^^^^

This is the standard model in SeisSol and it implements isotropic elastic materials. 
The constitutive behaviour is :math:`\sigma_{ij} =  \lambda \delta_{ij} \epsilon_{kk} + 2\mu \epsilon_{ij}` with stress :math:`\sigma` and strain :math:`\epsilon`. 
Elastic materials can be extended to elastoplastic materials (see :ref:`tpv-13`).

.. _anisotropic:

Anisotropic
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an extension of the elastic material, where direction-dependent effects also play a role. 
The stress strain relation is given by the :math:`\sigma_{ij} = c_{ijkl} \epsilon_{kl}`.
Whereas isotropic materials are described by two material parameters, the tensor :math:`c` has :math:`81` entries. 
Due to symmetry considerations there are only :math:`21` independent parameters, which have to be specified in the material file:
c11, c12, c13, c14, c15, c16, c22, c23, c24, c25, c26, c33, c34, c35, c36, c44, c45, c46, c55, c56, c66.
For more details about the anisotropic stiffness tensor, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law#Anisotropic_materials.
All parameters have to be set, even if they are zero.
If only the two Lam√© parameters are provided, SeisSol assumes isotropic behaviour. 

Anisotropy together with plasticity and dynamic rupture is not tested yet. 
You can define a dynamic rupture fault embedded in an isotropic material and have anisotropic regions elsewhere in the domain.

Viscoelastic
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Viscoelasticity is used to model the dissipation of wave energy over time. 
A full documentation can be found in :ref:`attenuation`.
