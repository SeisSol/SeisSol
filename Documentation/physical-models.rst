Physical Models
===============

Overview
--------

SeisSol includes various physical physical models to simulate realistic earthquake scenarios.

Elastic
^^^^^^^

This is the standard model in SeisSol and it implements isotropic elastic materials. 
The constitutive behaviour is :math:`\sigma =  \lambda tr(\epsilon) I + 2\mu \epsilon` with 
stress :math:`\sigma` and strain :math:`\epsilon`. Elastic materials can be extended to
elastoplastic materials (see :ref:`tpv-13`).

Anisotropic
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an extension of the elastic material, where direction-dependent effects
also play a role. Whereas isotropic materials are described by two material parameters, the most general formulation
needs :math:`21` material parameters: :math:`\sigma_{ij} = c_{ijkl} \epsilon_{kl}`.
In the material file you can give all :math:`21` parameters giving rise to triclinic 
anisotropic material behaviour. If only the two Lam√© parameters are provided, SeisSol assumes 
isotropic behaviour. Anisotropy together with plasticity and dynamic rupture is not tested yet. 
You can define a dynamic rupture fault embedded in an isotropic material and have anisotropic 
regions elsewhere in the domain.

Viscoelastic
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Viscoelasticity is used to model the dissipation of wave energy over time. 
A full documentation can be found in :ref:`attenuation`.
