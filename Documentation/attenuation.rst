Attenuation
===========

Introduction
------------

-  Q is measuring the decay of wave amplitude during its propagation in
   the medium and is physically defined as the ratio of wave energy to the energy dissipated per cycle of oscillation.
-  The actual dissipation mechanisms, as scattering, heat generation,
   frictional losses in the vibrating crystal lattice, etc., "causing Q"
   can be manifold and do not have to follow similar physics.
-  Q is not very frequency-dependent over a large range of (lower)
   frequencies but observations are ambiguous at higher frequencies.
-  Common choices are :math:`Q_s \sim 0.5 Q_p` and :math:`Q_s \sim 40-50V_s` (in km/s) (e.g.
   Olsen et al., 2009). :math:`Q_s = 100-200` for shallow sediments.
-  In damaged fault zones :math:`Q_s` would be expected to be as low as on the
   order of 10 and potentially smear out slip rate on the fault
   without affecting rupture speeds.

Implementation
--------------

-  Implementing attenuation in SeisSol follows the ideas of a general
   Maxwell or Zener body.
-  Each damping mechanism can be parametrized by its own relaxation
   frequency.
-  It aims at resolving a frequency-independent Q with an adequate
   number of anelastic functions and relaxation frequencies to cover the frequency range under interest. 
   Usually, 3 Maxwell bodies are enough for 5% error.

Stability with Local time stepping
----------------------------------

To ensure the stability of SeisSol using attenuation and local time-stepping (LTS),
it seems necessary to limit the number of clusters of the local time stepping.
Else, very large elements, rarely updated by the LTS, get unstable.
This can be achieved by using the following patch, which in most cases should not affect the LTS speed-up.

l_id_max, the maximum cluster id, is here hardcoded to 6. 
This probably depends on the minimum mesh size and the order of accuracy used.
The higher the order and the smaller the minimum mesh size, the larger l_id_max.
As we did not investigate in detail the dependence of l_id_max with the simulation order and the minimum mesh size, we did not include the patch in the master branch yet.

Compiling
---------


In SeisSol build configuration script replace

.. code:: python

   equations = 'elastic' 

by

.. code:: python

   equations = 'viscoelastic2'
   numberOfMechanisms = 3

Note that the equations='viscoelastic' is operational but deprecated.

Dispersion
----------

The attenuation implementation implies dispersion in P and S wave
velocities: that why we need to define a central frequency at which
:math:`V_p/V_s` are exact. In addition, the effective Q values are not exactly
equal to the desired Q, but are oscillating around those values. The
variation of :math:`V_p`, :math:`V_s`, :math:`Q_p` and :math:`Q_s` with frequency can be visualized using
`ViscoelasticModComp.m <https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol/blob/master/preprocessing/science/ViscoelasticModComp.m>`__.

Parametrisation
---------------

Add Inside the parameter file of SeisSol, in the '&equations' section 
(frequencies values to be adapted to the source frequency content):

.. code:: fortran

   FreqCentral=2.5
   FreqRatio=100

The spatial variation of :math:`Q_s` and :math:`Q_p` are defined with easi in the
MaterialFileName. Here is an example of easi file, in which :math:`Q_s` and :math:`Q_p`
are directly related to the shear wave speed :math:`V_s`:

.. code:: yaml

   !ASAGI
   file: ../material/vmodel_500.nc
   parameters: [rho, mu, lambda]
   var: data
   components: !FunctionMap
     map:
       rho:    return rho;
       mu:     return mu;
       lambda: return lambda;
       Qs:     return 0.1 * sqrt(mu/rho);
       Qp:     return 0.2 * sqrt(mu/rho);


FreqCentral and FreqRatio
-------------------------

| The relaxation frequencies are logarithmically equispaced, i.e.

| :math:`log(w_{i+1})-log(w_i) =` constant. 

In the parameter file, one has to give a frequency ratio of maximum to minimum frequency and a central frequency. 
For example, in the case of 3 mechanisms the following relations define the relaxation frequencies:

| :math:`w_2 = FreqCentral`  

| :math:`log(w_3)-log(w_2) = log(w_2) - log(w_1)`  

| :math:`w_3 / w_1 = FreqRatio`  

Outside of the frequency band :math:`w_1 - w_3`, Q goes to infinity, yielding
elastic behavior.
