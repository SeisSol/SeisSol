Gmsh
====

Introduction
------------

`Gmsh <http://gmsh.info/>`_ is an open-source
mesher, able to generate quality meshes for not too complex models.
Contrary to SimModeler, it can build geometric models from scratch. It
is particularly useful for simple idealized models, e.g. planar fault,
no topography. Two examples of model generation using Gmsh are provided
at this `link <https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol/tree/master/preprocessing/meshing/gmsh_example>`_.
The purpose of this tutorial is not to explain all functions of gmsh,
but to describe the features useful for setting a model and getting a
mesh for SeisSol.

Coarsening the mesh
-------------------

The Attractor Field feature is used to coarsen the mesh away from the
fault. As it requires a "Ruled Surface", we define an artificial "Ruled
Surface" used only for that feature. The rate of coarsening is defined
empirically by combining a linear increase of the mesh size in the near
field and a quadratic increase in the far size. Example:

.. code-block:: bash

  Field[2].F = Sprintf("0.1*F1 +(F1/5.0e3)^2 + %g", lc_fault);

Boundary conditions
-------------------

The free-surface (resp. dynamic rupture, resp. absorbing) boundary
conditions are set using Physical Surfaces 101 (resp. 103, resp. 105). 
The volumes should also be put into Physical Volume to be exported into
the mesh. Here is an example from tpv33:

.. code-block:: bash

  Physical Surface(101) = {252, 258, 260, 262};
  Physical Surface(105) = {242, 244, 246, 248, 250, 254, 256};
  Physical Surface(103) = {2, 3, 4};
  Physical Volume(2) = {276,278};
  Physical Volume(3) = {274};

Generating the mesh
-------------------

| Once the geometry and boundary conditions are set, the mesh can be
  obtained using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmsh test.geo -3 -optimize -format neu

Note that the '-format neu' is only possible since gmsh 4.0
For previous versions, we used `gmsh2gambit <https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol/tree/master/preprocessing/meshing/gmsh2gambit>`_
on the msh mesh generated with:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmsh test.geo -3 -optimize

| The optimize option is very important. If not used, mesh of very poor
  quality may be obtained. 

gmsh to SimModeler
------------------

| It is possible to create the geometry with gmsh and then mesh it with
  SimModeler. A way of doing so is to put all surfaces of the model in a
  "physical surface", mesh them (-2) and output them to an stl file (e.g.
  -o test.stl). Then the stl file can be opened with SimModeler and the mesh can be generated.
| If SimModeler merges some features of the geometry, it is then
  necessary to isolate the features in different stl files (i.e. running several times ``gmsh ___.geo -2 -o ___.stl`` with different surfaces listed in the physical surface listing). 
  Then the solid name attribute of the stl files has to be modified. Finally, the stl files can be
  merged into a single stl file, to be opened in SimModeler.

mirroring a mesh
----------------

In order to get maximum accuracy, it is sometimes necessary (e.g. for
benchmarks) to mirror a mesh. To get a mirrored mesh, a half mesh is
first generated. The half mesh is then converted to PUML format
using PUMGen (if not already in this format). Finally, this
`script <https://github.com/SeisSol/Meshing/blob/master/mirrorMesh/mirrorMesh.py>`_
allows creating the mirrored mesh

Add topography in GMSH
----------------------

The roughed fault interface model is generated with Gmsh is complicated
than planar faults in previous sections. There are 5 steps to generate
the model.

1.Create topography data. The format is the following:
  
::
  
   Line 1: num_x, num_y
   Line 2 to nx: positions of nodes along the strike (in meters)
   Line nx+3 to ny+nx+3: positions of nodes along the downdip (in meters)
   Line to the end: the topography of each node (nx\*ny, in meters)
   

Save this file as *mytopo.dat*.

2.Make a model with a plane surface first (step1.geo).

::

    cl = 1;

    // This file builds a rectangular box domain region which is exactly the same as topographic data.

    level = 0.0; // horizontal elevation
    region = 220; // range in meter
    depth = 100;

    Point(1) = { 0.5*region, 0.5*region, level, cl} ; //water level
    Point(2) = { -0.5*region,0.5*region, level, cl} ; 
    Point(3) = { -0.5*region,-0.5*region, level, cl} ; 
    Point(4) = { 0.5*region, -0.5*region, level, cl} ;

    Line(1) = {1,2}; Line(2) = {2,3}; Line(3) = {3,4}; Line(4) = {4,1}; 

    Point(5) = { 0.5*region, 0.5*region,-depth, cl} ; 
    Point(6) = { -0.5*region,0.5*region,-depth, cl} ;
    Point(7) = { -0.5*region,-0.5*region,-depth, cl} ; 
    Point(8) = { 0.5*region,-0.5*region, -depth, cl} ;

    Line(5) = {5,6}; Line(6) = {6,7}; Line(7) = {7,8}; Line(8) = {8,5}; 

    Line(9) = {1,5}; Line(10) = {2,6}; Line(11) = {3,7}; Line(12) = {4,8};

    Line Loop(1) = {  1,  2,   3,  4} ; Plane Surface(1) = {1} ;// the free surface
    Line Loop(2) = {  5,  6,   7,  8} ; Plane Surface(2) = {2} ;
    Line Loop(3) = {  -4, 12,  8,  -9} ; Plane Surface(3) = {3} ; //
    Line Loop(4) = {  9,  5, -10,  -1} ; Plane Surface(4) = {4} ;
    Line Loop(5) = { 10,  6,  -11, -2} ; Plane Surface(5) = {5} ;
    Line Loop(6) = { 11,  7,  -12, -3} ; Plane Surface(6) = {6} ;

    Physical Surface(101) = {1};// free surface
    Physical Surface(105) = {2,3,4,5,6};//absorb boundary

    Mesh.MshFileVersion = 1.0;

then generate msh file by:

::

  $ gmsh step1.geo -2 -o step1.msh

3.Use *gmsh_plane2topo.f90* and interpol_topo.in* to shift the planar
surface according to positions given in *mytopo.dat*.

:: 

  $ ./gmsh_plane2topo interpol_topo.in
  
gmsh_plane2topo.f90 can be found in https://github.com/daisy20170101/SeisSol_Cookbook/tree/master/tpv29

The format of interpol_topo.in is following:

::

  &input ! this is the input file for "interpol_topo"

  !
  !- name of the topography file:
  !
     TopoFile = 'mytopo.dat'
  !
  !- name of the input and output mesh files:
  !
     SkinMeshFileIn  = 'step1.msh'
     SkinMeshFileOut = 'step1_modified.msh'
  !
  !- face #s corresponding to the surface:
  !
     SurfaceMeshFaces = 1  ! free-surface will be modified
  !
  !- optionals:
  !
     MeshFacesToSmooth =  3, 4, 5,6  ! face #s 

     IterMaxSmooth = 100 ! default=200
     TolerSmooth   = 0.01 ! default=0.01

  / ! end of data
  

This will generate a step1\_modified.msh file containing topography. Load this in Gmsh to double-check.

4.Make a new step2.geo file that contains the topography and mesh
follow the general GMSH process.

The format of step2.geo is following:

::

  Merge "step1_modified.msh"; // merge modified msh

  Surface Loop(1) = {1,2,3,4,5,6};  
  Volume(1)={1};
  Physical Volume(1) = {1};

  Mesh.MshFileVersion = 2.2;

The new geometry with topography:

.. figure:: LatexFigures/GmshTopo.jpg
   :alt: Diagram showing the mesh with topography.
   :width: 11.00000cm

   Diagram showing the geometry with topography. 
   
5. Generate MSH mesh with the command line:
::

  & gmsh step2.geo -3 -optimize_netgen -o step2.msh
  
option optimize_netgen is necessary for optimizing meshing with good quality.
