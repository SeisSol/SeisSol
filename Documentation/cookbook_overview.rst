Overview
========

This documentation is a collection of useful dynamic simulation examples to help users build models from scratch with little effort. 
Each example is demonstrated carefully with geometry building, parameter setup, and result visualization. 
Users are suggested to repeat each example in order to get a comprehensive idea of how to set up dynamic simulation models with SeisSol. 

SeisSol is a part of SCEC dynamic code validation project (Harris et al. 2018) (http://strike.scec.org/cvws/). 
Here we show several SCEC benchmarks for beginners to quickly catch up with SeisSol workflow. 
Each benchmark example is composed of a short problem description, a section of *geometry, initial setups (stress, nucleation, friction, etc.)*, and *simulation results*.

Please note that the examples used here are only for demonstration purpose. 
For detailed benchmark tests please refer to SCEC benchmark center.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you begin any of the examples, you will need to install the latest
SeisSol from (https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol). The instruction can be found at https://seissol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html. All geometry and
tetrahedral meshes are generated using free software Gmsh (http://gmsh.info/).
If you do not wish to create your own mesh at this time, the meshes are
also provided as part of the example. The ParaView visualization package
(https://www.paraview.org/) may be used to view simulation results. You may use other visualization
software, but some adaptions from what is described here will be
necessary. Furthermore, you can complete a subset of the example using
files provided (as described below), skipping the steps for which you do
not have the proper software packages installed.

Input file resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The files needed to work through the examples are provided. 
All files necessary to set up the cookbook examples can be downloaded at https://github.com/SeisSol/Examples
