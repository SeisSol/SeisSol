If you have a problem using SeisSol,
please open a *discussion*. This could include things like:

* How do I set up a model (mesh, material parameters, ...)?
* How do I interpret/visualize results?
* How can I tune SeisSol for performance on my cluster?

You should open an issue if you found a possible bug, or you want to request
a new feature which is not yet implemented in SeisSol.
