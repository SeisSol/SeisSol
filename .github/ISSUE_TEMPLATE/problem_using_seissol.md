If you have a problem using SeisSol, please open a *discussion*. This could include things like:
* How do I set up a model (mesh, material parameters, ...).
* How do I interpret/visualize results.
* How can I tune SeisSol for performance on my cluster.

You should open an issue, if you found a possible bug or you want to request a new feature, which is not yet implemented in SeisSol.
